<p>The Siren Head is a unknown creature that lives in the dark forest of the woods.
   It is to be 15 foot tall, but when I had encountered the creature it seemed MUCH taller.
   Although maybe that was my fear giving me the illusion that it could be taller. When I went to 
   look for this creature I didn't believe in such an enity at first. Oh how wrong was I...my first encounterment
   with this being creature si it took on the voice of my mother. Being blinded I thought my mother was in danger
   so I acted and ran to the sound. However, when I came across the siren head it seems thrilled I fell right into its trap. 
   Now, I'm stuck in the forest chasing me scared...I think I understadn why we human tell these stories not for the sake fo a good story.
   Its to warn us about these creature. We don't know what could be after us, we don't know how it can control us,
   we don't know how it can give us fear...If anyone comes across this website, lemme ask you something...
   Did you lock your door?
